# Portfolio1

The aim of the project is to develop a Streamlit chatbot integrated with Langchain
technology, enabling natural language interactions with a SQL database to generate
visualizations and provide insights in real-time.

The e-commerce dataset consists of 7 interconnected datasets covering distribution
centers, user events, inventory items, order details, products, and user profiles.

Approach

A. Database Creation:
○ Install the MYSQL and MYSQL workbench on your system
○ Creating a new MYSQL database and loading the CSVs in to the database

B. Prompt Engineering Strategies:
○ Acting as a Role
○ Language Translation
○ Travelling Guide
○ Combining LLMs and Prompts in multi-step workflows

C. Langchain Integration:
○ Creating SQL agent that transform natural language queries into SQL
queries
○ Creating Python script agent that creates visualizations from SQL query
outputs
D. Streamlit Chatbot Creation

E. Integrating Memory and Guardrails

Project Achievement
1. Create Langchain agents for SQL query generation from natural language
2. Create Langchain agents for Python code generation from natural language
3.Gain insight into memory and guardrails, essential concepts in managing and
optimizing the performance of LLMs
4. Development of a Streamlit chatbot interface for intuitive data interaction and
visualization
